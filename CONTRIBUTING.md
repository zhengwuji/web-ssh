## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker (optional, for testing)

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zhengwuji/web-ssh.git
cd webssh

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or: venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set required environment variable
export SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
export DEBUG=True

# Run the application
python start.py
```

Open http://localhost:5000 and create a test account.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before opening an issue:
1. Check if the issue already exists
2. Try the latest version
3. Collect relevant info (browser, OS, error messages, logs)

Include in your bug report:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce
- Environment details (browser, OS, Docker version if applicable)

### Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome! Please include:
- Clear description of the feature
- Use case - why is this useful?
- Possible implementation approach (optional)

### Pull Requests

#### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues/PRs** - Someone might already be working on it
2. **Open an issue first** for larger changes - Let's discuss the approach
3. **Small PRs are better** - Easier to review and merge

For substantial work, state the user problem, expected outcome and acceptance criteria
in the linked issue/proposal. Include the reason for the chosen approach, validation,
compatibility/security impact and remaining rollout checks in the PR. Maintainers assign
accepted work to a release milestone; merging does not itself publish a release.
See the [planning and release workflow](docs/project-planning.md) for the lightweight cycle.

#### Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Test your changes locally
5. Commit with clear messages
6. Push to your fork
7. Open a Pull Request

#### Code Style

**Python:**
- Follow PEP 8
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Lean code: no unnecessary comments, docstrings only where logic is non-obvious

**JavaScript:**
- Vanilla JS only (no frameworks - intentional architecture decision)
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`

**General:**
- No trailing whitespace
- Files end with a newline
- Keep lines under 100 characters when reasonable

#### Commit Messages

Write clear commit messages:

```
Add SFTP directory creation support

- Implement mkdir operation in sftp_handler.py
- Add socket event handler for create_directory
- Update file manager UI with create folder button

Fixes #42
```

Format:
- First line: Brief summary (imperative mood, max 50 chars)
- Blank line
- Body: Explain what and why (wrap at 72 chars)
- Reference issues if applicable

#### Security Considerations

This project handles SSH credentials. When contributing, please:

- Never log passwords or private keys
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Check session ownership before operations
- Use parameterized queries (SQLAlchemy handles this)
- Clear sensitive data from memory when done
- Consider path traversal in file operations

If your change touches authentication, encryption, or session handling, please note this in your PR for extra review attention.

#### Public Repository Hygiene

Everything committed here is published. Do not commit local development
instructions, tool configuration, private notes, development captures,
temporary test output, workstation paths, credentials, or unreferenced media.
Keep reusable product and operator documentation in the public documentation areas.

Run the same repository guard used by CI before submitting:

```bash
python scripts/check_repository_hygiene.py
```

The guard inspects tracked files directly, so force-adding an ignored file does
not bypass it. Changes that add a forbidden path, an internal-instruction marker,
a workstation-specific tool path, or an unreferenced file under `assets/` fail
the required `dispatch-integrity` check.

#### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting:

1. **Manual testing** - Verify your changes work as expected
2. **Test edge cases** - Empty inputs, special characters, large files
3. **Check different browsers** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari at minimum
4. **Test with Docker** - Ensure containerized deployment works
   ```bash
   docker build -t webssh:test .
   docker run -p 5000:5000 -e SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32) -e CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5000 webssh:test
   ```

### Documentation

- Fix typos or unclear explanations
- Add examples
- Improve README
- Add inline code comments
