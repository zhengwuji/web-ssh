# Backup, Restore, and Secret Rotation

WebSSH provides native administrator and CLI workflows for backing up persistent state, validating archives, restoring an installation, and rotating a container-managed `SECRET_KEY`.

Backups are highly sensitive. An archive can contain user configuration, host information, the database, encrypted private keys, an admin-managed encrypted GitHub client secret, and the persisted application secret. Store it like a credential vault export.

## What a native backup contains

The archive covers the persistent `DATA_DIR` state required to restore the instance. Transient logs, temporary uploads, incomplete transfers, and runtime-only SSH channels are excluded.

Current archives use format version 2. The verifier also understands legacy format version 1/schema 0 for compatibility. Validation checks the manifest, file checksums, declared sizes, member paths, member count, compression behavior, and archive-wide limits before restore.

## Online backup in the web interface

![WebSSH backup and restore safety flow with administrator step-up, maintenance mode, private staging, validation, and atomic activation](https://github.com/zhengwuji/web-ssh/blob/main/docs/media/diagrams/backup-restore-safety.png?raw=true)

Backup and restore share the same authorization boundary but use different safe
paths. A backup coordinates writers before collecting consistent state. A
restore stays in an instance-specific, quota-bounded staging area until archive
validation and exact operator confirmation succeed.

An administrator can create a consistent backup while the service is online. SQLite uses its backup API and file writers are coordinated so that the archive represents a coherent point in time.

The completed download is one-time, session-bound, and expires after `BACKUP_DOWNLOAD_TTL` seconds, which defaults to 600. Temporary archive construction occurs outside `DATA_DIR` in an instance-specific namespace.

Do not rely on the short-lived browser download as retention. Move the archive immediately to encrypted, access-controlled backup storage.

## Restore in the web interface

Restore is deliberately disruptive and strongly confirmed:

Online restore is enabled only when `BACKUP_TEMP_DIR` is an absolute, private,
durable directory outside `DATA_DIR` and `BACKUP_RECOVERY_DURABLE=true` records
the operator's explicit acknowledgement. The rollback journal and emergency
archive live there, so the storage must survive both process termination and
container recreation. The repository Compose file provides the separate
`webssh_recovery` volume. A default system `/tmp` directory is suitable for
backup construction, but intentionally does not enable online restore.

1. Upload the archive.
2. Let WebSSH validate format and safety limits.
3. Review the restore target and warnings.
4. Complete the action-bound restore-prepare Step-up and acknowledge the sensitive operation.
5. Submit the issued session-bound confirmation token, the exact `RESTORE` phrase, and destructive-restore confirmation with a second action-bound Step-up.
6. WebSSH enters maintenance mode and stops accepting new work.
7. Active sessions and transfers are closed.
8. An emergency rollback archive is created.
9. Persistent state is replaced and sessions are invalidated.
10. The process terminates intentionally so the service manager can start a clean runtime.

If an interruption occurs during replacement, the restore workflow attempts rollback from the emergency archive. On restart, the durable recovery directory remains available for diagnosis or recovery. Still take an independent backup before every restore and keep it outside the instance.

## CLI backup and restore

CLI operations require every WebSSH process that uses the same `DATA_DIR` to be stopped. This avoids concurrent writers outside the coordinated web workflow.

Discover exact options in the installed version:

```bash
flask --app start:app backup create --help
flask --app start:app backup verify --help
flask --app start:app backup restore --help
```

For a container deployment, execute the command in a one-off container with the same data volume and configuration, while the normal application container is stopped.

Without `--destination`, `backup create --confirm-offline` retains the parent of
`DATA_DIR` as its default when writable. On a read-only or permission-restricted
parent, it writes to the private instance directory under `BACKUP_TEMP_DIR` and
prints the exact archive path. Explicit destinations are never redirected.
The supplied Compose recovery volume persists fallback archives; custom paths
must provide their own durability. Copy the result to encrypted off-host storage.
An archive in a one-off container's writable layer disappears with that container.

## Safety limits

Default operational limits include:

| Setting | Default |
|---|---:|
| Upload size | 1 GiB |
| Operation timeout | 30 minutes |
| One-time download lifetime | 10 minutes |
| Archive members | 10,000 |
| Individual uncompressed file | 1 GiB |
| Total uncompressed content | 10 GiB |
| Compression ratio | 200:1 |
| Manifest size | 10 MiB |

Reverse-proxy body-size and timeout settings must allow the same operation. Do not raise limits without assessing disk exhaustion and decompression-bomb risk.

## Secret-key rotation

The supported rotation command re-encrypts persisted secrets when WebSSH manages `DATA_DIR/secret_key`:

```bash
flask --app start:app rotate-secret-key --help
```

All WebSSH processes must be stopped. Take and verify a backup first. The command changes the root used for encrypted per-user SSH keys and invalidates signed session state, so a partial or interrupted manual replacement can make persisted credentials unreadable.

If `SECRET_KEY` comes from an external environment variable or secret manager, rotating only the external value is not sufficient. Plan a controlled migration that keeps the old key available while persisted SSH keys, TOTP values, and the GitHub App client secret are re-encrypted. The built-in command is scoped to the container-managed persisted secret.

## Restore drill

Test the full sequence on an isolated instance:

1. Create and download a backup.
2. Verify it with the CLI.
3. Start a disposable instance with an empty data volume.
4. Restore the archive.
5. Confirm local, LDAP/OIDC where applicable, Passkey, SSH, SFTP, and host-key data.
6. Confirm that old browser sessions are invalid.
7. Record the observed recovery time and required secret material.

An untested archive is not a verified recovery capability.
