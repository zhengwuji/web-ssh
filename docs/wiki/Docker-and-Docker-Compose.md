# Docker and Docker Compose

The official image is published at `ghcr.io/zhengwuji/web-ssh`. The container
runs as a non-root user and starts Gunicorn with one `gthread` worker.

## Persistent volume

Mount `/app/data` persistently:

```yaml
services:
  webssh:
    image: ghcr.io/zhengwuji/web-ssh:latest
    volumes:
      - webssh_data:/app/data

volumes:
  webssh_data:
```

Without this volume, users, profiles, keys, host trust, settings, backups, and
the auto-generated application secret disappear with the container.

The repository Compose file also mounts `webssh_recovery` at `/app/recovery`.
This separate durable volume stores online-restore rollback state and must not
be nested below or shared with `/app/data`.

## Base homelab deployment

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhengwuji/web-ssh/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

The base file publishes `5000:5000`, sets `DEPLOYMENT_PROFILE=homelab`, allows
wildcard CORS, uses HTTP-compatible cookies, enables tmux integration, and
persists `/app/data`.

Edit the Compose file to use a specific origin whenever possible:

```yaml
environment:
  - CORS_ORIGINS=http://192.0.2.10:5000
  - ALLOW_CORS_WILDCARD=false
```

## Application secret

When `SECRET_KEY` is not supplied, the container entrypoint creates a strong
secret and persists it at `DATA_DIR/secret_key`. This makes ordinary container
recreation safe as long as the data volume is preserved.

If the container `DATA_DIR` is overridden, it must be absolute and that exact
directory must be mounted persistently. Logs, keys, and `secret_key` all move
together. If a legacy `/app/data/secret_key` exists, copy it to the new
`DATA_DIR` with mode `0600` before starting; startup refuses to silently create
a second encryption root. An explicitly supplied external `SECRET_KEY` still
takes precedence and is not copied into the data directory.

Provide an external secret only when the deployment has a deliberate secret
management policy. A changed or lost `SECRET_KEY` invalidates browser sessions
and prevents decryption of stored SSH keys.

## Lifecycle and stop grace

The base service uses `stop_grace_period: 40s`. WebSSH accepts an application
shutdown grace of 1 to 30 seconds and defaults to 5. During shutdown it stops
accepting new work, signals runtime jobs, and waits only for the bounded grace.

Keep Docker's stop grace longer than `RUNTIME_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECONDS` so the
application can cancel readers and transfers before Docker sends a forced kill.

## Healthcheck

The image and Compose file probe `/ready` from inside the container. The default
healthcheck waits for:

- the application runtime to accept work;
- maintenance mode to be inactive;
- a successful SQLite query;
- a create/write/fsync/delete probe in `DATA_DIR`.

Inspect state with:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker inspect --format '{{json .State.Health}}' webssh
docker compose logs --tail=200 webssh
```

## Updating the image

Before updating, create and download a verified backup. Then:

```bash
docker compose pull webssh
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
curl -fsS http://localhost:5000/ready
```

If an earlier image already created the `webssh_recovery` volume with a
root-owned `/app/recovery` and startup now reports `Permission denied`, stop the
service before repairing it. An empty recovery volume may be removed and
recreated by Compose. Never remove a non-empty recovery volume during or after
an interrupted restore; preserve its contents and have an administrator change
the volume root to the image's `appuser` UID/GID with mode `0700` instead.

Record the currently deployed immutable image digest before replacing it:

```bash
docker image inspect \
  ghcr.io/zhengwuji/web-ssh:latest \
  --format '{{index .RepoDigests 0}}'
```

Use an immutable version tag or digest for controlled production rollouts.

## Optional Redis rate-limit storage

The default `memory://` backend resets rate counters when the process restarts.
To keep counters while Redis remains available, enable the private Redis service
from the supplied Compose comments and set:

```yaml
environment:
  - RATELIMIT_STORAGE_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
```

Do not publish the Redis port. If Redis becomes unavailable, WebSSH uses an
in-memory fallback and periodically retries the external backend.

Redis does not make multiple WebSSH workers safe. Live SSH transports and other
coordination remain process-local.

## Optional overlays

Compose files are applied from left to right. Later overlays win.

Production:

```bash
export WEBSSH_ORIGIN=https://ssh.example.com
docker compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.production.yml \
  up -d
```

LDAP plus production:

```bash
export WEBSSH_ORIGIN=https://ssh.example.com
docker compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.ldap.yml \
  -f docker-compose.production.yml \
  up -d
```

Always use base and overlay files from the same release or commit. The LDAP
overlay adds a read-only secret mount to WebSSH and a separate helper profile;
the production overlay follows it so its security settings are authoritative.
Optionally append `-f docker-compose.hardened.yml` after production to enable
additional container restrictions. Check custom writable paths, runtime UID/GID
and resource budgets before opting in; see
[container boundaries](https://github.com/zhengwuji/web-ssh/blob/main/docs/production-container.md).

## Inspect the effective configuration

Before changing a running deployment:

```bash
docker compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.production.yml \
  config
```

For LDAP, include `docker-compose.ldap.yml` in the same order used for startup.
Review published ports, environment values, mounts, and the selected image.

## Backup boundary

The `webssh_data` volume is covered by the native backup format. The separate
LDAP bind-password and CA volume is intentionally not included. Treat both as
secrets and document how each is restored.
