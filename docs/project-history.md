# WebSSH Project History

This retrospective explains what shipped and why the documented changes mattered.
It is reconstructed from public releases, PR descriptions, issue links and Git ancestry,
not from an original project plan. Reconstruction date: **2026-10-03**.

## Reading the evidence

- **Delivered:** the published tag contains the implementation's merge commit.
- **Documented reason:** a source explicitly describes the problem, root cause or goal.
- **Retrospective lesson:** an interpretation for future planning, not a claim about a
  decision that was documented at the time.
- Historical validation is evidence reported in the linked items, not tests rerun today.
  A historical release does not prove acceptance on every operator's real environment.

Release dates below are GitHub publication dates. They are not reconstructed deadlines.
Backfilled milestone creation/closure metadata must reflect the actual backfill operation.

## Before the first official release

The available Git history starts on **2026-01-23** with
[`2fcd38a`](https://github.com/zhengwuji/web-ssh/commit/2fcd38ad12cc1cf6d36563aace320ecb8a94e040).
The initial commit mentions `v1.0.0`, but that message is not a published GitHub Release.
The first official published release is **v1.0.0 on 2026-07-23**.

Early work already mixed security fixes, dependency updates and usability:
[#5](https://github.com/zhengwuji/web-ssh/pull/5) hardened logging, passwords, profiles and
network controls; [#20](https://github.com/zhengwuji/web-ssh/pull/20) addressed SSRF, login
timing, upload limits and a Socket.IO dependency issue;
[#36](https://github.com/zhengwuji/web-ssh/pull/36) added persistent tmux, replay and scrollback.
These belong to the first official release baseline, not invented pre-1.0 release milestones.

The 165 PRs in these release stages are assigned by their **first tagged inclusion**,
not by the week in which they merged. The machine-readable
[release history](release-history.json) lists every PR number, tag SHA, release URL,
comparison and verified issue-to-implementation link. Direct commits are covered by the
Git comparisons even though they have no PR to attach to a native milestone.

## v2.5.0 delivery and remaining acceptance

The original 2026-10-03 planning baseline contained 13 merged PRs after v2.4.0.
The published v2.5.0 tag adds #249, #250, #251 and #252, for 17 merged PRs in this release.
PR #253 was superseded by #252 and is not counted as a separately merged PR.

[Tag CI](https://github.com/zhengwuji/web-ssh/actions/runs/37276528581) and native image publication passed on `07f472691e61eab6554dd6f75cf56fb8333964ba`.
The maintainer authorized publication after the remaining deployment acceptance was
explicitly reported. Real Warpgate, deployment canary, upgrade/recovery and applicable
environment-specific checks remain tracked in [#254](https://github.com/zhengwuji/web-ssh/issues/254).
Release closure does not mark those checks passed.

[#237](https://github.com/zhengwuji/web-ssh/issues/237) and
[#238](https://github.com/zhengwuji/web-ssh/pull/238) first ship in v2.5.0, not v2.4.0.
[#245](https://github.com/zhengwuji/web-ssh/issues/245) was resolved by the reporter's
Warpgate PROXY-protocol configuration; it remains support evidence, not a shipped fix.
[#62](https://github.com/zhengwuji/web-ssh/issues/62) was converted to a database proposal
discussion and is likewise not counted as delivered implementation.

## Lessons for future planning

These are retrospective recommendations, not invented historical decisions:

1. **Validate observable behavior.** #165 explains why an emitted event was insufficient
   proof of scrolling. Acceptance should check what the user sees, including real devices
   when automated browser coverage cannot reproduce their input stack.
2. **Treat integration and delivery separately.** A merged feature or closed issue can
   precede a versioned release. Keep a separate release gate and record the exact candidate.
3. **Preserve compatibility explicitly.** #225 moved hardening into an opt-in overlay
   after it threatened established deployments. Capacity, identity-provider and rollback
   checks belong in the release record, not an implicit claim that green CI covers everything.
4. **Keep reasons and deferred work visible.** #20 explicitly deferred the large Paramiko
   upgrade; #60 later included Paramiko 5 with broader runtime/security work. Record such
   trade-offs instead of leaving a future reader to infer them from commit order.

## Limits of this reconstruction

No original release deadlines or complete private planning history were available. The
table summarizes documented purposes rather than claiming a pre-existing strategy.
Issue timelines show use of GitHub Projects, but this retrospective does not verify or
change the board's complete structure/status. The manifest preserves the dated native milestone backfill and subsequent release
updates. Check live GitHub metadata before making further assignments.
