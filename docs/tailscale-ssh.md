# Tailscale SSH deployment and security

WebSSH can authenticate to a target with the Tailscale identity of the machine
or container running WebSSH. The browser user does not provide a password or a
private SSH key. The target must have Tailscale SSH enabled with
`tailscale set --ssh`, and the tailnet policy must authorize the WebSSH node.

## Shared identity security model

Tailscale sees the WebSSH node, not the individual WebSSH account that clicked
Connect. Therefore every WebSSH user authorized for this feature shares the
same tailnet identity and all permissions assigned to that node or tag.

Use this mode only in a trusted homelab or similarly controlled environment:

1. Give WebSSH a dedicated tag such as `tag:webssh`.
2. Limit that tag to TCP port 22 on only the required target tag or hosts.
3. Limit Tailscale SSH rules to the required remote OS usernames.
4. Keep WebSSH registration disabled or tightly controlled.
5. Configure WebSSH's mandatory target and optional remote-username allowlists as a
   second boundary. Tailnet ACL and SSH policy remain authoritative.

Every authorized or denied Tailscale SSH attempt is written to the security
audit log with the WebSSH username, target, remote username, client IP, and the
`shared-node` identity marker.

## WebSSH configuration

Tailscale SSH is off by default. Enable it explicitly:

```env
TAILSCALE_SSH_ENABLED=true
TAILSCALE_SSH_ALLOWED_WEBSSH_USERS=operator
TAILSCALE_SSH_ALLOWED_TARGETS=tiny-server,100.64.0.10:2222
TAILSCALE_SSH_ALLOWED_REMOTE_USERS=root,ubuntu
TAILSCALE_SSH_INTERFACE=tailscale0
```

Administrators are allowed when the feature is enabled. The
`TAILSCALE_SSH_ALLOWED_WEBSSH_USERS` list grants access to additional WebSSH
usernames. The target allowlist is mandatory whenever the feature is enabled.
A bare hostname, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address means port 22. Use
`hostname:port`, `IPv4:port`, or `[IPv6]:port` for another port. Target matching
is exact and case-insensitive, while remote OS usernames are exact and
case-sensitive. A production deployment refuses to start when the enabled
feature has an empty or malformed target list or an empty interface. The
homelab profile emits security warnings, ignores individual malformed entries
so valid siblings still work, and fails every connection closed if no valid
target or interface remains. Values stay dormant while the feature is disabled.
After DNS resolution, WebSSH accepts only an
address whose kernel route uses `TAILSCALE_SSH_INTERFACE` (default
`tailscale0`), pins that address, and binds the connecting socket to the same
interface. A route change cannot silently move the connection to another
interface.

Tailscale authentication cannot be combined with ProxyJump. The route and
interface proof applies only to a direct connection from the WebSSH host.

## Example tailnet policy

Adapt tags, targets, and users to the deployment. This intentionally grants the
WebSSH tag only SSH access to tagged servers:

```json
{
  "tagOwners": {
    "tag:webssh": ["autogroup:admin"],
    "tag:servers": ["autogroup:admin"]
  },
  "grants": [
    {
      "src": ["tag:webssh"],
      "dst": ["tag:servers"],
      "ip": ["tcp:22"]
    }
  ],
  "ssh": [
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["tag:webssh"],
      "dst": ["tag:servers"],
      "users": ["root"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Docker sidecar with persistent state

The sidecar is a separate Tailscale container that shares its network namespace
with WebSSH. Its `/var/lib/tailscale` volume preserves node registration across
container updates and restarts. Publish the WebSSH port on the Tailscale service
because `network_mode: service:tailscale` gives both containers one network
namespace.

### Safe first-time setup

Do not enable Tailscale SSH on a fresh, publicly reachable WebSSH database.
Create the administrator explicitly on the Docker host before enabling the
shared Tailscale identity.

Bootstrap the deployment in this order:

1. Save and start the sidecar configuration below as-is on a trusted network.
   It deliberately starts with `TAILSCALE_SSH_ENABLED=false`.
2. Create the first administrator explicitly:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec webssh /app/entrypoint.sh flask --app start:app create-admin --username admin
   ```
3. Keep production self-registration disabled unless it is explicitly needed.
   Because the administrator was created first, every later account created
   through public registration is non-administrative. On an otherwise empty
   installation, the first registered account would become administrator.
4. Configure narrow target and remote-user allowlists, then change
   `TAILSCALE_SSH_ENABLED` to `true`.
5. Apply the updated configuration with `docker compose up -d`.

Production self-registration is always disabled. In the homelab profile, a
registration setting saved in the Admin Panel takes precedence over the
environment default.

### Homelab Compose example

This example follows the repository's existing homelab defaults: it permits
browser origins with `CORS_ORIGINS=*` and allows non-TLS HTTP cookies. Use it
only on a trusted network. The production HTTPS replacements are documented
immediately after the example.

```yaml
services:
  tailscale:
    image: tailscale/tailscale:stable
    hostname: webssh
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      - TS_AUTHKEY=${TS_AUTHKEY}
      - TS_AUTH_ONCE=true
      - TS_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/tailscale
      - TS_USERSPACE=false
      - TS_EXTRA_ARGS=--advertise-tags=tag:webssh
    volumes:
      - tailscale_state:/var/lib/tailscale
      - /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - NET_RAW

  webssh:
    image: ghcr.io/zhengwuji/web-ssh:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: service:tailscale
    depends_on:
      - tailscale
    environment:
      - HOST=0.0.0.0
      - PORT=5000
      # Trusted homelab defaults, matching the repository Compose file.
      - CORS_ORIGINS=*
      - ALLOW_CORS_WILDCARD=true
      - SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false
      # Keep online-restore rollback state durable and separate from DATA_DIR.
      - BACKUP_TEMP_DIR=/app/recovery
      - BACKUP_RECOVERY_DURABLE=true
      # Keep disabled until an administrator has been created with the CLI.
      - TAILSCALE_SSH_ENABLED=false
      # Leave empty to allow only existing WebSSH administrators.
      - TAILSCALE_SSH_ALLOWED_WEBSSH_USERS=
      - TAILSCALE_SSH_ALLOWED_TARGETS=tiny-server
      - TAILSCALE_SSH_ALLOWED_REMOTE_USERS=root
      - TAILSCALE_SSH_INTERFACE=tailscale0
    volumes:
      - webssh_data:/app/data
      - webssh_recovery:/app/recovery

volumes:
  tailscale_state:
  webssh_data:
  webssh_recovery:
    driver: local
```

After the administrator bootstrap and allowlist configuration, enable the
feature by changing the value to `TAILSCALE_SSH_ENABLED=true`.

For an HTTPS deployment, replace the three homelab browser settings with the
public origin and secure cookies:

```yaml
      - CORS_ORIGINS=https://ssh.example.com
      - SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true
```

Remove `ALLOW_CORS_WILDCARD=true` when using a specific origin. If a reverse
proxy on the Docker host terminates TLS, also bind the published port to
loopback so clients cannot bypass HTTPS:

```yaml
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:5000:5000"
```

For a containerized reverse proxy, remove the `ports` block instead, attach the
`tailscale` service and proxy to the same internal Docker network, and proxy to
`tailscale:5000`. In both cases, configure `TRUSTED_PROXIES` as described in the
main README. Do not list both the wildcard and the specific origin.

Supply `TS_AUTHKEY` at deployment time through an environment file or secret
manager; do not commit it to Compose. Prefer a tagged, reusable or OAuth-issued
credential with the minimum required tag permission. After the persisted node
state exists, `TS_AUTH_ONCE=true` prevents unnecessary reauthentication on each
restart.
